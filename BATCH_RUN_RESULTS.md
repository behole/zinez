## 🔧 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Cleanup:
1. **Filter out false positives**
   - Remove classic literature audiobooks
   - Remove radio shows (Dragnet, Suspense, etc.)
   - Remove software libraries
   - Remove academic books not related to zines

2. **Review and tag properly**
   - Verify MRR and Punk Planet entries (already good)
   - Check international and regional results
   - Ensure metadata is accurate

### Query Improvements:
```json
{
  "name": "US Hardcore Zines (Refined)",
  "query": "(flipside OR touch and go OR forced exposure) AND (punk OR hardcore) AND mediatype:texts NOT audiobook",
  "max_results": 40
}
```

Add exclusions for common false positives:
- `NOT audiobook`
- `NOT "librivox"`
- `NOT "classic literature"`
- `mediatype:texts` or `collection:zines`

### Expand What Worked:
1. **More MRR issues** - Collection has 300+ more
2. **Search by specific issue numbers**
3. **Target other magazine collections** (Flipside, Heartattack, etc.)
4. **Focus on collection:zines** specifically

---

## 📊 Database Health

### Current State:
- **Total entries:** 393
- **Legitimate punk zines:** ~300-320 (estimated 80%)
- **Related content:** ~50 (anarchist texts, music, academic)
- **False positives:** ~25-40 (audiobooks, software, etc.)

### Recommended Actions:
1. Create a cleanup script to flag/remove obvious false positives
2. Add `mediatype` filtering to future searches
3. Use `collection:zines` or `collection:punkplanet` style targeting
4. Manual review of questionable entries
